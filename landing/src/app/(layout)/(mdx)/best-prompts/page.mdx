# How to Get the Best ChatGPT Prompts and Use Them as Persons in DeskGPT

If you're looking to generate text using the ChatGPT language model, you may have come across the concept of using prompts to get the best results. But with so many prompts out there, how do you know which ones work the best? And how can you use those prompts with DeskGPT to generate text from different 'persons'?

In this post, we'll explore how to do just that. We'll cover some of the best sources for ChatGPT prompts, dive into how prompts can be used to create 'persons', and how DeskGPT can help you streamline the process.

## How to Find the Best ChatGPT Prompts

One of the best ways to find quality ChatGPT prompts is by accessing online resources with pre-made prompts. Here are three such resources that you can start with:

- [Awesome ChatGPT prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts): This GitHub page is a curated list of the best ChatGPT prompts by a community of developers. It provides a wide range of prompts suitable for many applications - from creative writing to business communication.

- [Prompt Engineering Daily](https://www.neatprompts.com/): This is a website that provides daily ChatGPT prompts, so if you're looking for a new prompt every day to use as a writing exercise or to generate fresh ideas, this might be the perfect option for you.

- [Jailbreak Chat](https://www.jailbreakchat.com/): This is a site that provides an interactive prompt-based chat experience using ChatGPT. You can enter a prompt and then chat with the 'person' that is generated by ChatGPT based on your prompt. This is a great way to get a feel for how ChatGPT can generate text on different topics, as well as how different prompts can influence the 'personality' of the generated text.

## Creating 'Persons' in DeskGPT

Using prompts to generate text from different 'persons' is a unique feature of DeskGPT. This feature is enabled by having a database of prompts with distinct personalities and using that prompt as the basis for generating text. Here's how to do it:

1. Choose the 'Person' that you want to generate text from or add a new one by writing a prompt. For example, if you want to generate text from Elon Musk, you can write a prompt that matches his writing style or personality.

2. Once you've entered your prompt, DeskGPT uses ChatGPT to generate the text accordingly.

3. You can switch between different 'persons' with ease, allowing you to generate text with different tones, styles, and personalities.

## Conclusion

Using prompts with ChatGPT can help you generate text that is more informative, engaging, and persuasive. Plus, with the ability to create new 'persons' in DeskGPT, you can leverage prompts to generate text that seems like it was written by different people. By using the resources mentioned above and DeskGPT, you have everything you need to start generating high-quality text in no time.
