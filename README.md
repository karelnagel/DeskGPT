# [DeskGPT](https://deskgpt.vercel.app/)
 
 This is a native app for Mac, Windows and Linux that allows you to access ChatGPT fast and easily.
 
 The app lives in your menu bar and allows you to quickly access chatGPT from anywhere on your computer, 
 just by pressing `ctrl/cmd + shift + G`, or by clicking on the icon in your menu bar. It automatically focuses on the input field, so you can start typing right away, and sends with pressing enter, not like some other alternatives.

 Right now only way to use it is to register on [OpenAI website](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and get your API key, that you can then paste into the app.

 It also has a prompt field so you can make it act a certain way.

## Why

ChatGPT is useful for many things, and I didn't find any other native app that allowed me to access it easily. And also ChatGPT API is imo much faster then the web version.
